<a>IMPORTANT NOTEPAD++ LICENSE TERMS<a>

Copyright (C)2003 Don HO <don.h@free.fr>.  This program is free software; you may redistribute and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; Version 2 with the clarifications and exceptions described below. This guarantees your right to use, modify, and redistribute this software under certain conditions.

Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "derived works", yet it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid misunderstandings, we consider an application to constitute a "derivative work" for the purpose of this license if it does any of the following:
1. Integrates source code from Notepad++.
2. Integrates/includes/aggregates Notepad++ into a proprietary executable installer, such as those produced by InstallShield.
3. Links to a library or executes a program that does any of the above.

Our interpretation applies only to Notepad++ - we don't speak for other people's GPL works.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.
